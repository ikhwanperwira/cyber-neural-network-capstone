# Inference Service with Python Keras

This repository contains code for building an inference service using Python and Keras. The inference service allows you to deploy trained Keras models and make predictions using HTTP requests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the inference service, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Keras (version X.X.X)
- Flask (version X.X.X)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
  ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

  ```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Start the inference service:

  ```shell
  python app.py
  ```

4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/predict` with the input data in the request body. The expected input format is [describe input format].

## Customization

You can customize the inference service by modifying the `app.py` file. Feel free to add additional endpoints, implement authentication, or integrate with other services.
